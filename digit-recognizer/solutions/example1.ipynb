    "# Digit Recognizer in Python using Convolutional Neural Nets\n",
    "by [Koba Khitalishvili](http://www.kobakhit.com/)\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "I used Mathematica and a standard Neural Network model to get ~0.98 accuracy score after 40 minutes of computing. Starting with a brief benchmark Python code [found in the forums](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/forums/t/2299/getting-started-python-sample-code-random-forest) one can jump into solving the Digit Recognizer\n",
    "problem right away. Below code that uses Random Forest algorithm to classify images as digits will give you \n",
    "around 0.96 accuracy score in less than a minute which is great. However, this score will put you lower than the 200th place. \n",
    "According to [MNIST web page](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), convolutional neural networks algorithm yields good results.\n",
    "I will try a simple neural network algorithm out in Python, expand it into a convolutional neural network and see if I can break into the top 100."

    "has superb report generating options, setting up Python environment can be and was for me a tiring experience. Nevertheless, it pays off because \n",
    "Python framework is well developed for solving data problems. For instance, Mathematica does not even have a CNN\n",
    "implementation available as of 11/4/2015 and everything is done under the hood whereas in a Python framework one \n",
    "can find almost any algorithm imaginable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among Python, R and Julia I beleive Python and R are most competitive data science technologies with Julia being \n",
    "in the process of maturing. Choosing Python over R and vica versa really has to do with either individual preference or\n",
